1. **Inputs** (your research docs like Site Exec, Digital Presence, Market Dynamics, Gap Analysis, Influencer Patterns).
2. **Processing** (how to reference them in Claude Code / Cursor Agent).
3. **Outputs** (Revenue Projection + First Content Draft).

Here’s a ready-to-drop **`Synthesizer.md`** you can hand over:

# 🔄 Synthesizer Workflow Guide

This document explains how to **combine your research markdown files inside Cursor + Claude Code** into revenue-driving outputs.
It uses Firecrawl MCP, Perplexity MCP, and Claude’s reasoning to move from **insights → action → ROI**.

---

## 📂 Inputs (Research Layer)

Make sure you have these files in your project:

* `Site-Exec-Summary.md` → ICP, UVPs, proof, brand voice (baseline context)
* `Digital-Presence-Audit.md` → how you’re showing up vs. competitors
* `Market-Dynamics.md` → trends, search data, emerging angles
* `Content-Gap-Analysis.md` → the specific exploitable gaps
* `Influencer-Patterns.md` → language, hooks, frameworks from top creators

---

## ⚙️ Step 1. Reference Research in Cursor

Open the Cursor Agent or Claude Code terminal and run:

```
Reference Site-Exec-Summary.md, Digital-Presence-Audit.md, 
Market-Dynamics.md, Content-Gap-Analysis.md, Influencer-Patterns.md.
Based on these, prioritize 3 high-impact opportunities 
for content + campaigns.
```

Claude will now read across all docs → and output a **shortlist of plays**.

---

## 🧩 Step 2. Map to Revenue

Use the shortlist to model business upside:

```
Using Content-Gap-Analysis.md + Influencer-Patterns.md, 
map each gap to a revenue stream. 
Estimate traffic, CTR, conversion rate, and ARPU. 
Save results as Revenue-Projection.md.
```

Deliverable:

* `Revenue-Projection.md` → ROI scenarios

---

## ✍️ Step 3. Draft First Asset

Pick one opportunity and draft a launch-ready asset:

```
Reference Site-Exec-Summary.md + Influencer-Patterns.md.  
Expand the "Clinical Influencer" angle into a LinkedIn post draft.  
Direct, professional tone. Include CTA. Save as First-Content-Draft.md.
```

Deliverable:

* `First-Content-Draft.md` → publishable asset

---

## 🚀 Step 4. Iterate & Scale

Feedback loop:

* Ask Claude: *“Make this beginner-friendly.”*
* Or: *“Turn this into a Twitter thread.”*
* Or: *“Expand into a landing page.”*

Each iteration = new `.md` file you can reuse.

---

## 📦 Outputs (Action Layer)

* `Revenue-Projection.md` → ROI modeling
* `First-Content-Draft.md` → post/page ready to publish

Optional expansions:

* Calendarized content plan (`Priority-Content-Plan.md`)
* Cross-platform adaptations (`TikTok-Scripts.md`, `YouTube-Outline.md`, etc.)

---

✅ **End-to-End Flow Recap**

1. Crawl site + competitors → generate `.md` research docs.
2. Reference them in Claude Code → synthesize gaps + angles.
3. Map angles → revenue (`Revenue-Projection.md`).
4. Draft first campaign asset (`First-Content-Draft.md`).
5. Iterate into a full content system.
