# Setup Claude Code in Cursor

This guide shows you how to set up **Claude Code** inside Cursor (or Windsurf / VS Code) so you can use **Opus 4** directly in your IDE.

---

## ⚠️ Before You Begin
- A **Claude Max subscription** ($100–$200/month) → [Sign up here](https://claude.ai)  
- Cursor (or Windsurf / VS Code) installed  
- Access to your **integrated terminal**

---

## 1. Subscribe to Claude Max

---

## 2. Install Claude Code
1. Copy the **install command** from Claude’s website (after subscription).  
2. Open **Cursor’s integrated terminal**.  
3. Paste the command, e.g.:

👉 That way it matches the **style, spacing, and structure** of your Content Gap Analysis doc.  

Would you like me to also **rebuild the Setup Claude Code doc in the exact “template” style (with callouts like 📌 Prompt to Run, ✅ Deliverables, etc.)** so all your `.md` guides feel consistent?
