# Setup-Claude-Code.md

This guide helps you set up **Claude Code** as your development + research environment.

---

## ⚠️ Before You Begin

* A **Mac** (steps below assume macOS with terminal access).
* A **Claude Desktop subscription** (~$20/mo at time of transcript).
* A **GitHub account** (for version control).
* (Optional but recommended) A **Vercel account** (for deployment).

---

## 1. Install Claude Code

1. Open your **Mac terminal**.
2. Search for the **Claude Code install command** (or ask ChatGPT/Claude directly).  
   Example:

   ```bash
   brew install claude-code
````

*(Replace with the actual command provided by Claude Desktop after subscription.)*
3. Log in via **Claude Desktop** (authenticate once, link to your subscription).
4. When finished, Claude Code will be available in your terminal.

---

## 2. Authenticate + Link

* After install, Claude Desktop will pop up → log in & authorize.
* This connects terminal commands (`claude` / `claude-code`) to your account.

---

## 3. GitHub Setup

1. Create a **GitHub repository** (private or public).
2. In Claude Code, ask:

   ```
   How do I push this project to GitHub?
   ```

   → It will walk you through `git init`, `git remote add`, and `git push`.
3. Benefit: version control, ability to roll back, share, and collaborate.

---

## 4. Deploy with Vercel

1. Sign up at [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
2. Connect your GitHub repo.
3. Every time you **push code to GitHub**, Vercel auto-updates your deployed site.

   * No manual redeploys required.
   * Great for **non-technical marketers**: write → push → live site.

---

## 5. Sanity Check

Run in terminal:

```bash
claude --version
```

✅ Should return the installed Claude Code version.

Push a small repo:

```bash
git add .  
git commit -m "first commit"  
git push origin main  
```

✅ Verify code syncs with GitHub.

Check Vercel deployment:

* Push a code update → confirm Vercel redeploys automatically.

---

## Quick Recap

* **Claude Code** = AI pair programmer in your terminal.
* **GitHub** = version control for your projects.
* **Vercel** = instant deploy pipeline tied to GitHub.
