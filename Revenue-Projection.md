## 📌 Prompt to Run in Cursor

“Using content and gap opportunities identified in `Content-Gap-Analysis.md` + `Influencer-Patterns.md`,
model the potential revenue impact for [brand/business].

Break down:

* **Traffic assumptions** (visitors/mo, growth rate)
* **CTR to leads**
* **Conversion to paying clients**
* **Average revenue per client / product**
* **Revenue streams** (services, programs, courses, workshops, etc.)

Output:

1. Projection table (monthly + annual)
2. Best / worst / expected case scenarios
3. Channel-level contribution (TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, X, etc.)

Save results as `Revenue-Projection.md`.”

Optional follow-ups:

* *“Add a sensitivity analysis: what happens if conversion improves by 1%?”*
* *“Show break-even timeline given $X monthly spend on ads/tools.”*
* *“Translate projections into a pitch deck slide format.”*
