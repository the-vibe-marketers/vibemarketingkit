# First Post Draft (AIDA-Style)

**Hook (Attention):**  
“Just spent 2 hours doing what normally takes 2 weeks.”

**Interest:**  
Here’s how I went from 0→1 on marketing research using MCPs + AI.

**Desire (Process Recap):**
1. **Website Intelligence (15 min)**  
   Firecrawl MCP crawled my site → extracted UVPs, ICP, brand voice
2. **Competitive Gap Analysis (30 min)**  
   Perplexity MCP mapped competitors → found 7 major gaps
3. **Content Prioritization (15 min)**  
   Cursor Agent synthesized → 12 low-effort / high-impact ideas

**Action (CTA):**  
MCPs aren’t magic. They’re just really good plumbing.  
But good plumbing = 10x faster research, clearer strategies, and more time for execution.
